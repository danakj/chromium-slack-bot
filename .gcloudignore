# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
.git
.gitignore

# Transitively include anything that isn't part of the git repo.
#!include:.gitignore

# This is not part of the git repo so it's ignored by .gitignore, but we do
# want to deploy it.
!config.json

# These don't exist for us (yet?).
